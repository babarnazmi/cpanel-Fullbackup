   [Blog Post on blogs.silicontechnix.com](http://blogs.silicontechnix.com/?p=710)

    Working script to take full backup (all files+databases+emails) 
    manually or using crontab services on CPanel based hosting servers.

    It needs CPanel account details and FTP host/account details.

    Most of the scripts for doing full backups are either old, totally unusable or  commercial. 

    So here is a **Open Source and Free** tool for everyone.

    I wrote one for my own use and sharing here so others donâ€™t need to re-invent the wheel.
